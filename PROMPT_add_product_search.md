Implement Variant B: add a product search to the UI WITHOUT changing the backend.

Requirements:
- Add a search input on the Products list page (top of the page).
- Filter displayed products in real time as the user types.
- Search must match product name OR description (case-insensitive).
- No backend/API changes. Keep endpoints as-is.
- Keep UI minimal and consistent with current style (inline styles are fine).
- Preserve existing functionality: product list, detail, cart, checkout.

After implementation:
- Verify local dev still works (npm run dev).
- Verify docker still works (docker compose up --build).
- Commit and push changes to your branch.
